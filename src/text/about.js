            The story of Lutheran High School, Obot Idim, Uyo started on December 10, 1930, when the congregation of the sixteen villages in Ibesikpo namely: Nung Udoe, Nung Ukana, Ikot Essien, Ikot Ekwere, Ikot Iko, Ikot Akpan Abia, Ikot Oduot, Ikot Oku Ubo, Ikot Obio Offong, Mbikpong Ikot Edim, Ebere Otu, Afaha Ibesikpo, Afaha Ikot Osom, Mbierebe Obio, Ito Oko and Ikot Okubo all in Ibesikpo Asutan L.G.A of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, left the Qua Iboe Mission in protest after many years of unsatisfactory relationship. Under the leadership of Chief Nyong Etim Udo, the people formed what was known as <q>Ibesikpo United Church</q>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Two years after, the Ibesikpo United Church, which later became <q>Evangelical Lutheran Church</q> when Rev. Dr. Jonathan Udo Ekong, whom the former sent to the United States of America to source for a mission which they (Ibesikpo United Church) could be affiliated to, saw an article written by Prof. Martin S. Sommer titled: <q>AFRICA - WE OUGHT TO BE THERE.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
            The article was an answer to the prayer Rev. Dr. Jonathan Udo Ekong, the founder of Lutheran Church in Nigeria needed and without any waste of time, he established a relationship with the Americans and negotiations commenced.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1934, the decision to visit and establish a Church in Ibesikpo on the request of the Ibesikpo United Church through their representative Rev. Dr. Ekong, was taken. Rev. Henry Nau with Pastor Immanuel Alberht and Pastor Otto A. Boecler arrived in Nigeria on January 5, 1935. A month after, the three white missionaries arrived Nung Udoe, where they stayed for 6 months and were received by Chief Nyong Etim Udo, Effiong Akpan Ukpong, Frank Mazza Udo, N. E. Eton, Akpa Eso, Asuquo Udo Ekong, and Andrew Udo Akpan. Rev. Henry Nau later came to Nigeria and officially established what is known today as the <b>Lutheran Church of Nigeria</b> (formerly Evangelical Lutheran Mission) in April 1936. The coming of the Lutheran Mission was not only to establish Church. <q>The early missionaries sent to Nigeria in pursuance of the Spiritual cum, educational development agenda also possessed teaching and administrative credentials, which fully equipped them for the pioneering initiative in the establishment and administration of educational institutions. In this regard, the Lutheran mission worked tirelessly to plant both the gospel, hospitals and schools in a good number of locations in the country. Primary Schools such as Boeder Memorial School, Obot Idim, Lutheran Teachers Training College, Ibakachi, Immanuel Hospital, Eket , <b>Lutheran High Schools, Obot Idim, Uyo and Ikot Obong Eron, Ikot Ekpene</b> respectively, were established purely as Christian Schools meant for the development of manpower for the mission and the nation</q>, according to Ofonime Inyang.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Evangelical Lutheran Church "considers Christian education of children very important" (Amamkpa et al 1986; 83) being one of her cardinal objectives in pursuance of her guiding philosophy of "The Soul of Education is the Education of the Soul”. After the intention of the Evangelical Lutheran Mission to establish schools was made known to the then Ministry of Education at Enugu, as presented by the resident missionary, Rev. Henry Nau, who came back to Nigeria with a cream of white scholars and missionaries such as Rev. John Louis Konz, Mr. P. Dharmapalam, Mrs. N. H. Reim among others, <b>approval was given to the church in December 27, 1949 to establish the prestigious Lutheran High School, Obot Idim and others</b>. Entrance examination was immediately conducted and about five hundred (500) candidates sat for it out of which twenty eight (28) were successful.
        </p>

        <p>
            These successful twenty eight pioneer students along with seasoned members of staff started what Ofonime Inyang described as "a well rounded qualitative and result oriented secondary education at the premises of Boechler Memorial Primary School" on <b>January 28, 1950</b>. Rev. J. P Kretzmann who led in this historical devotion on that occasion took his lesson from Deutronomy 6: 6 - 9. <blockquote>"And these words, which I commend thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when. thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shall bind then for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shall write them upon the post of thy house, and on thy gates" (KJV)</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            These words of the Lord ministered on the first day of opening created great impact not only on the lives of the students and members of the staff, but on the institution itself. No wonder Lutheran High School, Obot Idim has made so much impact globally in all fields of human endeavour. It is very true that Lutheran High School, Obot Idim was established on Christian foundation. The result of her achievement is enviable; positive impact made is enormous, her contribution to academic excellence and manpower development globally is unparalleled.
        </p>

        <p>
            Between 1955 and 1961 enrolment witnessed a meteoric rise as application for placement snowballed each year. Specifically by 1961, about nineteen teachers were on hand to satisfy the instructional yearnings of about 348 students, a development which necessitated the need for expansion and the eventual movement from Boecler Memorial School to the present site Great Luthisco Republic.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Rev. John Louis Konz deserves a special mention for his pioneering effort in laying a solid foundation on which the fledging institution needed and depended upon for sustenance and growth. It is on record that this young American missionary, teacher and administrator nurtured the right kind of leadership potentials, which the School thrived on. It is to his credit that a wide range of subjects were taught, the students cutting across the sciences to the liberal arts. Mr. E. E. Nkanga, Dr. Ime Udo, HRM Edidem Ita Bassey Etuk, all agreed that they received motivation which has impacted their lives and endeavours from the leadership style and administrative disposition of Rev. J. L. Konz. In his good will message to the Golden Jubilee Anniversary, the Rev. Konz exuded some level of complimentary devotion to the ideals which he set up as a pioneer head of the institution. His words… <blockquote>"We recall the faithfulness of the tutors and the discipline and determination of the students to succeed." (Konz 2000)</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Following Rev. Konz was the dynamic forward-looking, amiable disciplinarian Mr. A. A. Obot who succeeded the Rev. Konz as principal. Mr. Obot goes down the record as the very first African and indigenous person to head the institution. He was ably supported by a disciplined crop of teaching staff which included Mr. E. A. Ubom. Mr. E. B. Attah, Mr. P. Dharmapalam, Mr. SM. Udofia, Mr. A. E. Inyang, Mr. O. E. Okpo, Mr. J. Ekanem, Mr. E. K. Nwankwo, Mr. U. P. Akanwan. Miss I. K. Odiba, Miss G. N Etim. Mr. B. A. Nyong, Mr. V. J. Ekong, Chief E. U Ekong, Mr. 0. I. Inyang, Mr. J. J. Ntia, Mr. E. N. Oko and, Mr. J. A. Ibanga.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mr. A. A. Obot was very unrelenting in his pursuit of excellence in academic standard and discipline. In an article, which is published in "A Word from the Principal" column in the second volume of The Luthiscolian, the students association magazine, Mr. Obot enunciates the need for students to pursue their educational careers objectively. In his words: <blockquote>“I like to encourage our present and future students to study very hard for both themselves and for this nation”. (Luthiscolian: 8).</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Many students of the institution who belonged to the pioneer class have also made tremendous impact in their chosen field of endeavour. Examples are: Engr. Koon Akpanekong, Etim John Nkop, Eteidung (Barr.) Ita Etuk, Eyo Udo Ekong (Senior Prefect) among others. Other former students of the school in subsequent years have also registered the name of the school on the marble of history. Examples are Dr. Ime Joseph Udo who is a physician of reputable standing, Mr. Otu Ben Udo (former School Prefect), Mrs. May Usoro ( former Girls' Prefect now a retired school administrator), Rev. Dr. Udo Etuk, scholar and University Professor, Justices Edet R. Nkop, Effiong D. U. Idiong - former Chief Judges of Akwa Ibom State, Engr. Martin Essien formerly of the Petroleum Training Institute, Efurrun, Delta State, Rev. Offiong Udo Idiong, Obong Aqua E. Aqua, former National President of RAlTAWU, now Director, AKS Ministry of Culture and Tourism, former Principal of Lutheran High School, Obot Idim, Mrs. Nsidibe Ekong, Okon Efanga Akpabio, HRH Chief Dr. John Dennis Osaronu, Air Marshall Nsikak Eduok. former Chief of Air Staff, Air Commodore Ita Udo Ime, former Minister for Aviation, DIG Archibong Nkanga, retired Police Chief, Engr. Enobong Billy Etuk, businessman and politician, Engr. Nse Idio, paint manufacturer/industrialist. Dr. Martin Akpan, prolific writer and medical practitioner, Rev. Dr. Uduakabasi B. Udofia, a medical doctor and international evangelist, Iniobong S. Jimmy, former General Manager, British Airways among others too numerous to mention.

            The academic records of LHS have always been impressive right from her inception so much so that INSPECTORS OF EDUCATION in the then Eastern Region, from Enugu once made the following observation:<br/>
            Lutheran High School, Obot Idim is one of the best schools in the country going by her academic standard: LHS has produced the best of minds in the academia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her academic record has been very high, impressive, highly commendable judging from the number of admissions granted to students in higher institutions within and outside the country. A very popular grade A School. Lutheran High School, Obot Idim can effectively and comfortably compete with all other schools of her class anywhere in the country (School Records, Ministry of Education, Enugu 1961).

            Lutheran High School, Obot Idim was predominantly a boarding school until the early 70s when day-studentship was introduced. Life in the dormitory was so exciting and unique that no serious minded student of the school would have ever wanted to miss the dormitory because of the friendly boarding experience, sophisticated boarding facilities down to decent meals, good discipline and high moral training and interactions/ fellowships among students. Students derived many advantages by being in the boarding house. Boarders were and still are regarded as first class citizens in the "Luthisco Republic". Female students were / are not left out. While male students are housed in four hostels namely Nau, Luther, Ekong and Konz, the girls are accommodated in the then Lizzy hall. In the then Luthsico Republic, Nau and Luther houses are popularly known as Old Colony, while Ekong and Konz houses constitute the New Colony.

        <p>
            Academic excellence is one area that cannot be divorced from Lutheran High School. From available records, LHS has been associated with high academic standard right from the days of Rev. J. L. Konz. It is on record that, in 1974 Academic Session under the headship of Mr. E. A. Ubom as the Principal, the School made the best result in West African School Certificate (WASC) examination in the West African sub-region. Accordingly LHS became the first secondary school in the country to enjoy the special privilege of conducting her WASC examination without external supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discipline was high as well. This attracted people from far and near to seek admission in the school. It is therefore to her eternal glory that her products are today known for their disciplined conduct in their homes, communities, associations, careers/professions, and work places.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lutheran High School, Obot Idim also excelled in extra curricula activities to the admiration of sister institutions. As a result, of her outstanding performances, the, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) approved the establishment of a UNESCO CLUB in the School. Lutheran High School, Obot Idim became one of the three schools chosen and sponsored by UNESCO in the then Eastern States of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students enjoyed well-organized variety shows every weekend including football, debate, drama etc. LHS was never left out of any important competitive event in the area of sports, debates and drama. These activities greatly boosted the students' morale and gave them self-confidence while preparing them for a result-oriented educational pursuit.

            While other schools were busy identifying houses and hostels with colours, number or letters, <b>Lutheran High School, Obot Idim was the first school in this part of the world that came out with a concept of naming houses/hostels after some distinguished personalities</b> who have made this great institution. For instance, Luther House is named after Martin Luther, the founder of the Lutheran Church Worldwide. Luther House has RED as her colour. NAU House is named after Rev. Henry Nau, the first Resident Missionary who brought Lutheran Church to Nigeria. GREEN is her colour. Rev John Louis Konz who accompanied Rev. Henry Nau to Nigeria as a missionary became the first principal. Konz House, which is named after him has BLUE as her colour, EKONG HOUSE / HOSTEL is named after Rev. Jonathan Udo Ekong the founder of Lutheran Church of Nigeria. YELLOW is her colour.

        <p>
            Apart from the hostels, other buildings named after important dignitaries are: The school auditorium (named after Mr. A. A.

            Yes, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to teaching and learning, but our teachers are trained to be adaptive in adopting the general best practices that would be effective in reaching positive learning outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to make learning relevant and engaging in all circumstances. We encourage our teachers to use real world examples and allow students to  explore topics that interest them by granting them guided access to our facilities for independent research. We continuously create a safe and supportive environment, where our students feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. Overall, we encourage critical thinking and independent learning, rather than just rote memorization.

            <li><b>Project-based learning</b> - here we involve our students to work on projects that address real-world problems.</li>
            <li><b>Inquiry-based learning</b> - here we encourage students to ask questions and explore answers through research and hands-on activities.</li>
            <li><b>Collaborative learning</b> - This approach involves students working together in groups to solve problems and complete tasks.</li>
